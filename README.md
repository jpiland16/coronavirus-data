<h2>About this project</h2>

This project was intended to make <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv" target="_blank">data</a>  from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a> more easily available. I was inspired by the graphs available at <a href="https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/" target="_blank">91-DIVOC</a> and so I created a similar project with county-level granularity. My site also stores session information in the URL parameters, such that you may bookmark a graph and return to the same viewing mode.

<h2>How to use this site</h2>

<p>NOTE: This site has been confirmed to work on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Chromium) - latest versions. Other browsers may not be supported.</p>
<p>This site displays information about COVID-19 cases by county and state level. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv" target="_blank">Data</a> is obtained from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>To get started, select a state and a county. Data will be shown for that county. Selecting another county will add that county to the graph. Counties can be removed at anytime using the list at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>The y-axis can be set to be linear or logarithmic. The x-axis can be offset for each dataset showing the time since 5 cases were reported, or it can show all available data.</p>
<p>To view data by state, select "By State" rather than "By County." States can be added and removed in the same manner as counties.</p>
<p>Metrics available to analyze both states and counties include Total Cases, New Cases per day, New Cases per day (7-day rolling average), Percent Growth per day, and Percent Growth per day (7-day rolling average).</p>
<p>To view the top 20 states/counties based on the <i>current metric</i>, use the State Top 20 option to show the top 20 <u>counties</u> in the selected <u>state</u>, or use the US Top 20 option to show the top 20 <u>states or counties</u> in the United States. Note that data for counties with low numbers of cases may not be included.</p>
<p>To create a custom ranking, with the option to choose lowest (rather than highest) data, use the Custom Rank option.</p>
<p>The URL in your address bar is automatically updated with the options you have selected. To save your current layout, simply bookmark or favorite this page in your browser. Also, note that the back and forward buttons function as "undo" and "redo," respectively.</p>
